I have written a three step [Getting Started manual for Jekyll](/getting-started/). The manual can be followed by anyone (no command line needed). Everything you need to do, can be done in a browser and a text editor.

Jekyll/a static sites are quick to develop, simple to adjust, hosting is cheaper and they can be easily optimized for SEO and speed. As a bonus, static websites are extremely stable and they can handle a huge amount of visitors.

So do you want a next-generation website? Follow the [manual](/getting-started/)! Your first Jekyll site is only minutes away!
