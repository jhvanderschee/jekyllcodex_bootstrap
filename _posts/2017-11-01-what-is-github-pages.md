Ready to get started? Build your own site from for free at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and use Jekyll Codex for all your code snippets! Github Pages even offers manuals on how to set up Jekyll, how to use your own custom domain, and how to create custom 404 pages. Just so you know: This website is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/jhvanderschee/jekyllcodex) too.
